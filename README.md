The main learning  in this app was to manipulated routes, how they work in the right way, in addition to creating MVC design patterns, learn about using `nunjucks` to render views.

In addition, the process of authentication and user creation was created step by step through the use of Sequelize for BD, configured in a PostgresSQL database, using a Docker virtual machine to do so.

  
 ### HOW TO USE:
It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED USE OF YARN and some linux terminal, in case you are with windows, you can use the GIT terminal.

 
  - First you will need to have docker installed on your machine: https://www.docker.com/get-started.
  - Create an account on the docker site, and once installed, log in to that account.
  - Do the DB installation, by the terminal using `docker run --name database -p 5432:5432 -d -t kartoza/postgis`.
  - Create a database with the name "gobarber".
