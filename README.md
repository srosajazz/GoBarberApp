# APP GOBARBER
- App created with NodeJs

The main learning  in this app was to manipulated routes, how they work in the right way, in addition to creating MVC design patterns, learn about using nunjucks to render views.

In addition, the process of authentication and user creation was created step by step through the use of Sequelize for BD, configured in a PostgresSQL database, using a Docker virtual machine to do so.
